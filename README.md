# re-frame-template

Leiningen template for [reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) web apps that implements the [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) pattern.

Through the use of profiles, this template lets the developer pick and choose what is included in their application.

## Usage

The base template includes:

* [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame)
* [figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel)

To create an application with the base template:

```
lein new re-frame <project-name>
```

The optional profiles include:

* [posh](https://github.com/mpdairy/posh) (`+posh`)
* [garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden) (`+garden`)
* [re-com](https://github.com/Day8/re-com) (`+re-com`)
* [secretary](https://github.com/gf3/secretary) (`+routes`)
* [cljs.test](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/master/src/main/cljs/cljs/test.cljs) and [doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo) (`+test`)
* [compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure) (`+handler`)

To add a profile to the base template, just append the profile name (let's use `+re-com` as an example):

```
lein new re-frame <project-name> +re-com
```

Any combination of profiles can be added at once (let's add many profiles as an example):

```
lein new re-frame <project-name> +garden +re-com +routes +test
```

## Development Mode

### Compile css (if using +garden):

Compile css file once.

```
lein garden once
```

Automatically recompile css file on change.

```
lein garden auto
```

### Run application:

```
lein clean
lein figwheel dev
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).

### Logging:

In _project-name.config_, there is a variable called `debug?`, which
defaults to _true_. However, for the `min` build, this variable is
re-defined to _false_.

When `debug?` is true, we include `(enable-console-print!)`. If you wrap all of your `println`s with a `when` block as show below, then you will get logs printed to the browser's console for the `dev` build and not the `min` build.

```clojure
(when config/debug?
  (println "dev mode"))
```

### Run tests (if using +test):

```
lein clean
lein doo phantom test once
```

The above command assumes that you have [phantomjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phantomjs) installed. However, please note that [doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo) can be configured to run cljs.test in many other JS environments (chrome, ie, safari, opera, slimer, node, rhino, or nashorn). 

## Production Build

```
lein clean
lein cljsbuild once min
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcomed!  To add a new profile, this is what I'd recommend:

1. Add a file with the name of the profile [here](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-template/tree/master/src/leiningen/new/options)
2. Look at the existing options in that folder for inspiration for what to include in that file
3. Update [project.clj](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-template/blob/master/src/leiningen/new/re_frame.clj) with the profile
4. Add any new files [here](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-template/tree/master/src/leiningen/new/re_frame) and use the {{ var-name }} syntax as needed
5. Update the [README](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-template/tree/master/src/leiningen/new/re_frame) that will result when the template is used, as well as the top-level [README](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-template/blob/master/README.md) for re-frame-template itself
6. In a terminal, at the root of re-frame-template, run `lein install`
7. Locally test that your profile works, `lein new re-frame <app-name> +<profile-name>`
8. Add your profile to [create-templates](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-template/blob/master/create-templates.sh) and run the script to make sure the other profiles didn't break.

Desired profiles:

* `+heroku`
